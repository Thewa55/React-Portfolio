            Hello, my name is Kin-Wai Lam. I currently reside in Edison, NJ and currently a student in Rugters Web Developer Bootcamp. I just finished my first week in the bootcamp and had a lot of ups and down. This is my first site I've made using bootstrap, and it feels like a blessing in disguise. After learning CSS and html, I applied what I learned into building a webpage from scratch for my first homework. Just making the layout of the webpage took a couple of hours and trying to align everything to make it look appealing took even more time.
          </p>

            Bootstrap is a very useful tool, it cuts down the time needed to create a layout. Aligning the page with columns and rows makes the website more visually aesthetic and pleasing. The only con I can think of is with bootstrap is that you need to learn classes to add to the syntax in order to get certain elements where and act how you would like. The pros definitely outweighs the cons of bootstrap as a quick google search can usually yield the class you need. I hope you will enjoy my first project using bootstrap as much as I had fun making it!
